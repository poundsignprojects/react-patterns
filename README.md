### A small experiment in generating patterns using just triangles and squares.

I have long had a fascination with patterns. I used to be a weaver, and it was such a wonder to see the complex patterns that could be created on a simple machine made of wood.

I enjoy seeing the patterns and possibilities in tiles. Usually it's a simple shape or two that, when mirrored and repeated, can create a very satisfying pttern.

Recently I have taken to drawing patterns on gridded paper with just a few simple shapes. At the base of things I'm really just using triangles and squares. Each grid box can either have a square or a triangle in 1 of 4 orientations in it (it can also be blank). Adding multiple colors can add to the complexity and beauty of the pattern.

In this code experiment, I'm setting up a small grid and randomly applying shapes to each grid square. The grid is then mirrored and repeated to create a pattern. I've included settings to change the grid size, the pattern repeat size, and the colors.
